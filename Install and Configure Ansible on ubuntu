Take a ubuntu machime and run the command as  - 
1) apt update
2) apt install ansible -y // Here by default /etc/ansible/hosts and /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg is not created
3) sudo mkdir -p /etc/ansible
   sudo touch /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
   sudo touch /etc/ansible/hosts
4) In /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, add
  [defaults]
  inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts
5) In /etc/ansible/hosts, here we are adding all the servers ip address
  [servers]
  server1 ansible_host=<p ip address of host>
  server2
  .
  .
6) Add .pem file at ~/.ssh location. For example ~/.ssh/ansible.pem. // There will be also authorized_key.
7) To check the connection run the command
   ansible all -m ping --private-key=~/.ssh/ansible.pem
8) To create a file on worker or host
   ansible all -m file -a "path=/file1 state=touch" --private-key=~/.ssh/ansible.pem
9) Now one file will be created on the host machine

This is example to update the system and install docker in it
- hosts: server1
  become: yes
  tasks:
   - name: Update the system
     apt:
       update_cache: yes
   - name: Installing docker on the server
     apt:
       name: docker.io
       state: present
